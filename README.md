This is my Weather Dashboard app for School named Weather Station X

Type city name into input box and click the button to search current conditions

and also be presented with a 5 day forecast.

It will store your previous searches in the menu to the left,

a clear search history button has not been implemented yet.

It is non responsive, but you can still use it on mobile

it just might not look the greatest. (will be working on this in future)
